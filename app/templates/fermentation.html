<h2>Fermenting</h2>

<h3>Measure the Secific Graivity</h3>
<p>Your hydrometer will be used to measure the specific gravity (density) of the wort. For exmaple, a reading of 1.10 means the wort is 1.1 times as dense as water. this actually is enough to get your beer to about 10% alcohol, but that's just a crude estimate. To get an accurate reading of the ABV (alcohol by volume) you need to make a final specific gravity measurement jsut before bottling the beer. Using the first and final specific gravity numbers, you can make a reasonably accurate calculation of ABV.</p>

<h3>Pitch the Yeast</h3>
<p>Once the hopped wort is lukewarm, you'll add your yeast. A "smack pack" from your local homebrew shop will have billions of yeast to outnumber any microbes that fall in. Just pour it straight into your carboy.  <strong>You will want to smack the pack to activate the yeast an hour or two before this!</strong> Then add an airlock, and wait! The airlock allows bubbles of carbon dioxide out of your continer while preventing oxygen from getting in. As the yeast consume all the oxygen and repoduce, they amount of oxygen will become too low, and the yeast can no longer do aerobic respiration  (the same kind you and I do when we breath and burn sugars). When humans don't have enough oxygen, such as when we run a distance, we need to keep breaking down sugar and getting energy. But without enough oxygen, we cannot do it the "regular" way. Instead we resort  to lactic acid fermentation. This is a way we can get extra energy by producing lactic acid instead of carbon dioxide.  The catch? It builds up in our muscles and makes them sore! So aerobic respiration is better.</p>

<h3>Primary Fermentation</h3>
<p>Yeast also prefer to do areobic respiration, but once the oxygen is depleted, they need to keep consuming sugar for energy to stay alive. And unlike humans, yeast can do this for a LONG time without oxygen. But they do alcoholic fermentation (making alcohol rather than lactic acid). Eventually they run out of food and die  (or if there is too much sugar, they die of alcohol poisoning!) Either way you end up with dead yeast that sink to the bottom of your carboy.</p>

<h3>Secondary Fermentation</h3>
<p>After about 1-2 weeks, most of the yeast will have died and there will be a thick layer of sludge on the bottom of your carboy. In order to have clear beer, you'll want to getrid of the sludge. But you can't just pour it out, its on teh bottom of the container! And you shouldn't just pour the beer off the top! That would expose it to oxygen and aerate it!</p>

<p>Why is oxygen a problem now? Becuase yeast aren't the only things that could be lurking in your beer. There are still sugars around, and with oxygen present, some microbes might grow and ruin your beer. Or you could have some acetobacter that will convert the alcohol the yeast made into vinegar. So the solution is to siphon the beer off the top of the yeast. This way you minimize exposure to oxygen.  Position your racking cane in the bottom of hte container, but above the yeast bed. Then siphon hte beer thorugh your tubing and into a second carboy to finish fermenting. Hence the name secondary fermentation. </p>
